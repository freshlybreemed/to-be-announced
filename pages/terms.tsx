      <h3>11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION </h3>
      <p>
        11.1 In the interest of resolving disputes between you and SOCIAL
        TICKETING in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and
        SOCIAL TICKETING agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way
        related to these Terms of Use or your use of the App or Services will be
        resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a
        lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a
        judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and
        can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award
        the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to
        arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way
        related to these Terms of Use or your use of the App or Services,
        whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or
        any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during
        or after the termination of these Terms of Use. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE
        THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU AND SOCIAL TICKETING ARE
        EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS
        ACTION AND THAT THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY
        THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.
      </p>
      <p>
        {' '}
        11.2 Notwithstanding Section 11.1 above, nothing in these Terms of Use
        will be deemed to waive, preclude or otherwise limit the right of either
        party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b)
        pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state or
        local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in
        aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (d) to
        file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property
        infringement claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        11.3 Any arbitration between you and SOCIAL TICKETING will be governed
        by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution
        Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes
        (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association
        (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms of Use, and will be administered by
        the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at
        www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator has
        exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the
        interpretation, applicability or enforceability of this binding
        arbitration agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        {' '}
        11.4 A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written
        notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail (“Notice”). SOCIAL
        TICKETING’s address for Notice is: 3500 S. DuPont Highway, Dover, DE
        19901, Attn: Chief Executive Officer. The Notice must: (a) describe the
        nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific
        relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to
        resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement
        to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or SOCIAL
        TICKETING may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the
        arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or SOCIAL
        TICKETING must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
        arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is
        finally resolved through arbitration in your favor with a monetary award
        that exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by SOCIAL
        TICKETING prior to selection of an arbitrator, SOCIAL TICKETING will pay
        you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the
        arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by
        SOCIAL TICKETING in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s
        award; or (iii) $15,000. 11.5 If you commence arbitration in accordance
        with these Terms of Use, SOCIAL TICKETING will reimburse you for your
        payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or
        as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be
        decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a
        location to be agreed upon in the State of Delaware, but if the claim is
        for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be
        conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the
        arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c)
        by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county
        (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either
        the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is
        frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the
        standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the
        payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you
        agree to reimburse SOCIAL TICKETING for all monies previously disbursed
        by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
        Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the
        arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain
        the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award,
        if any, are based. Each party agrees that such written decision, and
        information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential
        except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial
        review of the award. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve
        disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any
        time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made
        within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits. Notwithstanding
        anything in these Terms of Use to the contrary, and for the avoidance of
        doubt, the arbitrator can award injunctive relief as a remedy in any
        arbitration required under this Section 11.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        11.6 YOU AND SOCIAL TICKETING AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST
        THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF
        OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
        Further, unless both you and SOCIAL TICKETING agree otherwise, the
        arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may
        not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class
        proceeding.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        11.7 Except as otherwise provided in these Terms of Use, if SOCIAL
        TICKETING makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other
        than a change to SOCIAL TICKETING’s address for Notice, you may reject
        the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to
        SOCIAL TICKETING’s address for Notice, in which case this arbitration
        provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected,
        will continue to govern any disputes between you and SOCIAL TICKETING.
      </p>
      <p>
        11.8 If Section 11.6 above is found to be unenforceable or if the
        entirety of this Section 11 is found to be unenforceable, then the
        entirety of this Section 11 will be null and void, and, in that case,
        the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in
        Section 12.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to these
        Terms of Use.{' '}

        12.2 These Terms of Use are governed by the internal substantive laws of
        the State of Delaware without respect to its conflict of laws
        provisions. You and SOCIAL TICKETING submit to the personal and
        exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located
        within the State of Delawarefor resolution of any lawsuit or court
        proceeding permitted under these Terms. You agree that no joint venture,
        partnership, employment or agency relationship exists between you and
        SOCIAL TICKETING as a result of these Terms of Use or use of the App or
        Services. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found to be invalid
        by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such
        provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of
        these Terms of Use, which will remain in full force and effect. Failure
        of SOCIAL TICKETING to act on or enforce any provision of these Terms of
        Use will not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other
        provision in these Terms of Use. No waiver will be effective against
        SOCIAL TICKETING unless made in writing, and no such waiver will be
        construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance. These Terms
        of Use, together with the Privacy Policy and Purchase Terms, constitutes
        the entire agreement between you and SOCIAL TICKETING with respect to
        the subject matter of such documents, and supersede all previous or
        contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties
        with respect to the subject matter therein. The Section headings in
